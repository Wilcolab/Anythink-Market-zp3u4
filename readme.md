When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

1. Go to Docker offical website and intall docker according to your machine.
2. If you are strugglig its okay GOOGLE IT :)
3. Once the docker is install i had to install "WSL2 Linux kernel update package for x64 machines"
